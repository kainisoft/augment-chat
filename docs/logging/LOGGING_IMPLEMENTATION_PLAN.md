- [x] Test end-to-end log flow from Kafka to Loki

### Step 2.5: Create Log Management API
- [x] Implement REST API for log management
- [x] Add endpoints for querying logs
- [x] Add endpoints for managing log levels
- [x] Create API documentation
- [x] Add validation using class-validator and class-transformer

## Phase 3: Common Logging Library

### Step 3.1: Create Kafka Log Transport
- [x] Create Winston transport for Kafka
- [x] Implement log formatting and serialization

### Step 3.3: Implement Logging Middleware and Interceptors
- [x] Update HTTP logging middleware to include request IDs
- [x] Enhance logging interceptor with performance metrics
- [x] Improve error logging with stack traces and context
- [x] Test middleware and interceptors in sample service

## Phase 4: Microservice Integration

### Step 4.1: Update API Gateway Logging
- [x] Integrate common logging library in API Gateway
- [x] Configure appropriate log levels
- [x] Add service-specific context
- [x] Test log flow from API Gateway to Grafana

### Step 4.2: Update Auth Service Logging
