# Redis Implementation Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the Redis Cluster implementation in the chat application. Redis is used for caching, session management, and real-time features across the microservices.

## Overview

Redis is a critical component of the chat application, providing:

- **Caching**: Improve performance by caching database queries and API responses
- **Session Management**: Store and manage user sessions for authentication
- **Real-time Features**: Enable real-time chat functionality with pub/sub
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse with rate limiting
- **Distributed Locking**: Coordinate operations across microservices

## Redis Cluster Architecture

### Local Development

The local development environment uses a 3-node Redis Cluster running in Docker:

- **Node 1**: localhost:6379
- **Node 2**: localhost:6380
- **Node 3**: localhost:6381

Configuration files are located in `docker/config/redis/`.

### Production Deployment

The production environment will use a 6-node Redis Cluster (3 masters, 3 replicas) running on EC2 instances:

- Deployed across 3 availability zones for high availability
- Using t3.medium instances (t3.micro for staging)
- Placed in private subnets with no public IP addresses
- Secured with security groups allowing only internal VPC traffic
- Configured with both RDB snapshots and AOF logs for persistence
- Monitored with CloudWatch and custom dashboards
- Backed up daily to S3 with a rotation policy
