## Current Progress

### Server Development
- [x] Phase 1, Step 1: Initialize NestJS monorepo using Workspaces with Fastify
- [x] Phase 1, Step 2: Set up Docker configuration for local development
- [x] Phase 1, Step 3: Configure Kafka for local development
- [x] Phase 1, Step 4: Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB with Docker Compose

### Client Development
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 1: Initialize Next.js web client project
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 2: Set up Next.js with Apollo Client
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 3: Configure project structure and styling with Tailwind CSS

### Infrastructure
- [x] Phase 1, Step 1: Create Docker Compose configuration for local development
- [x] Phase 1, Step 2: Set up service-specific Dockerfiles
- [x] Phase 1, Step 3: Configure ports 4000+ for all microservices

## Next Steps
1. Initialize the Next.js web client project
2. Implement authentication service functionality
3. Develop user service features
4. Create chat service core functionality
5. Set up notification service

## Special Implementation Notes
- Redis will be implemented as a custom Redis Cluster on EC2 instances in production
- All Redis communication will use private IP addresses for security
- Local development will simulate the cluster setup with Docker containers
- Microservices will use port 4000 and higher (API Gateway: 4000, Auth: 4001, User: 4002, Chat: 4003, Notification: 4004)
