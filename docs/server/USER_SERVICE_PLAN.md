## Database Schema

### Users Table
- `id` (UUID): Primary key
- `authId` (UUID): Reference to Authentication service user
- `username` (String): Unique username
- `displayName` (String): User's display name
- `bio` (String): User biography
- `avatarUrl` (String): Profile picture URL
- `createdAt` (DateTime): Account creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` (DateTime): Last update timestamp

### Relationships Table
- `id` (UUID): Primary key
- `userId` (UUID): Foreign key to Users table (requester)
- `targetId` (UUID): Foreign key to Users table (target)
- `type` (Enum): Relationship type (friend, blocked, etc.)
- `status` (Enum): Status (pending, accepted, rejected)
- `createdAt` (DateTime): Relationship creation timestamp
- `updatedAt` (DateTime): Last update timestamp

### Settings Table
- `id` (UUID): Primary key
- `userId` (UUID): Foreign key to Users table
- `key` (String): Setting key
- `value` (JSON): Setting value
- `updatedAt` (DateTime): Last update timestamp

## GraphQL API

### Schema Design
The User Service exposes a GraphQL API with the following main types:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  displayName: String!
  bio: String
  avatarUrl: String
  status: UserStatus!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  relationships: [Relationship!]
  settings: [UserSetting!]
}

type Relationship {
  id: ID!
  user: User!
  target: User!
  type: RelationshipType!
  status: RelationshipStatus!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type UserSetting {
  id: ID!
  user: User!
  key: String!
  value: JSON!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

enum UserStatus {
  ONLINE
  OFFLINE
  AWAY
  DO_NOT_DISTURB
}

enum RelationshipType {
  FRIEND
  BLOCKED
  MUTED
}

enum RelationshipStatus {
  PENDING
  ACCEPTED
  REJECTED
}
```

### Queries
- `user(id: ID!): User` - Get user profile by ID
- `me: User` - Get current user's profile
- `users(filter: UserFilterInput, pagination: PaginationInput): UserConnection!` - Search for users
- `userRelationships(userId: ID!, type: RelationshipType): [Relationship!]!` - Get user relationships
- `userSettings(userId: ID!): [UserSetting!]!` - Get user settings

### Mutations
- `updateUserProfile(input: UpdateUserProfileInput!): User!` - Update user profile
- `deleteUser(id: ID!): Boolean!` - Delete user account
- `createRelationship(input: CreateRelationshipInput!): Relationship!` - Create relationship request
- `updateRelationship(id: ID!, input: UpdateRelationshipInput!): Relationship!` - Update relationship
- `deleteRelationship(id: ID!): Boolean!` - Delete relationship
- `updateUserSetting(key: String!, value: JSON!): UserSetting!` - Update user setting

### Subscriptions
- `userStatusChanged(userId: ID!): UserStatus!` - Subscribe to user status changes
- `relationshipUpdated(userId: ID!): Relationship!` - Subscribe to relationship updates

### Health Checks
- `GET /health` - Service health check endpoint (REST endpoint for Kubernetes health checks)

## Integration with Auth Service

The User Service integrates with the Authentication Service in the following ways:

1. **User Creation**: When a user registers through the Auth Service, a corresponding user profile is created in the User Service.

2. **Authentication**: The User Service uses the IAM library for authentication and authorization, which is also used by the Auth Service.

3. **User Deletion**: When a user account is deleted, the Auth Service communicates with the User Service to delete the corresponding user profile.

4. **Event Communication**: The services communicate via Kafka events:
   - `UserRegisteredEvent` from Auth Service triggers user profile creation
   - `UserDeletedEvent` from User Service triggers auth record deletion
   - `UserEmailChangedEvent` from Auth Service triggers profile update

5. **Session Management**: Both services use the Redis library for session management and caching.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing the User Service, the following prerequisites need to be addressed:

1. **Database Schema Creation**: Ensure the User Service database schema is properly defined in the Database library.

2. **CQRS Framework Setup**: Set up the CQRS module for the User Service, similar to the Auth Service implementation.

3. **Domain Model Definition**: Define the domain models following DDD principles.

4. **Repository Interfaces**: Define the repository interfaces for both read and write operations.

5. **Integration with IAM Library**: Ensure proper integration with the IAM library for authentication and authorization.

6. **GraphQL Dependencies**: Install and configure the following packages:
   - `@nestjs/graphql` - NestJS GraphQL module
   - `@nestjs/apollo` - NestJS Apollo integration
   - `apollo-server-fastify` - Apollo Server for Fastify
   - `graphql` - GraphQL core library
   - `graphql-subscriptions` - For GraphQL subscriptions
   - `dataloader` - For efficient data loading
   - `@graphql-codegen/cli` - For generating TypeScript types from schema

7. **GraphQL Schema Design**: Design the GraphQL schema following best practices:
   - Use clear, consistent naming conventions
   - Implement proper pagination (cursor-based)
   - Design efficient nested resolvers
   - Plan subscription architecture
