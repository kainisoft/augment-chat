## Testing Coverage Summary

### âœ… Fully Standardized Testing Patterns

1. **Mock Factories**: Complete coverage for all service dependencies
2. **Test Builders**: ServiceTestBuilder, ControllerTestBuilder, IntegrationTestBuilder
3. **Test Setup**: Standardized module configuration and dependency injection
4. **Test Data**: Shared test data generation and domain object factories
5. **Repository Mocks**: Complete CRUD operation coverage
6. **Service Mocks**: All business logic services with proper return values
7. **CQRS Mocks**: Command, Query, and Event bus implementations
8. **Cache Mocks**: Redis cache operations with proper behavior
