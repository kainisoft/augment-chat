# Performance Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for performance monitoring, optimization, and best practices across all microservices in the chat application.

## Overview

The performance documentation covers the complete lifecycle of performance management, from baseline establishment to ongoing monitoring and optimization. All performance tools and procedures are integrated with the shared infrastructure modules to ensure consistency across services.

## Performance Tools and Scripts

The following performance analysis tools are available in the `server/scripts/performance/` directory:

### Bundle Analysis
- **bundle-analyzer.ts**: Analyzes bundle sizes and shared module impact
- **dependency-analyzer.ts**: Identifies unused and heavy dependencies
- **tree-shaking-optimizer.ts**: Analyzes export usage and tree-shaking effectiveness

### Performance Monitoring
- **performance-monitor.ts**: Comprehensive performance analysis and monitoring
- **memory-tracker.ts**: Memory usage tracking and leak detection
- **response-time-analyzer.ts**: Response time measurement and analysis

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run comprehensive performance analysis
pnpm perf:monitor

# Analyze bundle sizes
pnpm perf:bundle

# Check for unused dependencies
pnpm perf:deps

# Analyze tree-shaking effectiveness
pnpm perf:treeshake

# Monitor memory usage
pnpm perf:memory

# Measure response times
pnpm perf:response
```

- **Caching**: ValidationCacheService with LRU cache and TTL
- **Memory Optimization**: Object pooling and memory-efficient operations

## Integration with Shared Infrastructure

The performance monitoring system is fully integrated with shared infrastructure modules:

- **@app/metrics**: Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- **@app/bootstrap**: Enhanced service startup with performance tracking
- **@app/config**: Configuration management for performance settings
- **@app/logging**: Performance event logging and analysis

## Quick Start Guide

### For Developers
1. Run `pnpm perf:monitor` to get a comprehensive performance overview
2. Check the generated reports in `performance-reports/` directory
3. Review performance best practices before making changes
4. Use performance budgets to validate changes

### For Operations
1. Follow daily monitoring procedures in [Performance Monitoring Procedures](PERFORMANCE_MONITORING_PROCEDURES.md)
2. Set up alerting based on performance thresholds
3. Review weekly performance trends
4. Escalate performance issues according to documented procedures

### For Architecture Decisions
1. Consult [Performance Best Practices](PERFORMANCE_BEST_PRACTICES.md) for guidance
2. Use performance metrics to validate architectural changes
3. Consider performance impact when adding new shared modules
4. Document performance implications of architectural decisions
