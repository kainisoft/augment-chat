- ✅ Shared infrastructure modules (@app/validation, @app/dtos, @app/security, @app/testing) exist
- ✅ TypeScript path mappings configured
- ✅ Package dependencies installed

#### Step 1: Authentication DTOs Migration (Week 1)

**Objective**: Replace service-specific authentication DTOs with shared versions from @app/dtos.

**Scope**: This step applies **only to auth-service** as it's the only service that handles authentication DTOs. User-service uses GraphQL input types and does not have authentication DTOs.

**Files to Update**:

**Auth Service**:
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/login.dto.ts` → Replace with @app/dtos
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/register.dto.ts` → Replace with @app/dtos
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/refresh-token.dto.ts` → Replace with @app/dtos
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/auth-response.dto.ts` → Replace with @app/dtos
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/presentation/dtos/auth/login.dto.ts` → Remove duplicate
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/presentation/dtos/auth/register.dto.ts` → Remove duplicate
- ✅ `server/apps/auth-service/src/presentation/dtos/auth/auth-response.dto.ts` → Remove duplicate

**User Service**:
- ✅ No authentication DTOs found (uses GraphQL input types)
- ✅ No duplicate DTOs found (application/dtos and presentation/dtos directories are empty)
- ✅ Already uses shared error classes from @app/common/errors
- ✅ GraphQL pagination types are service-specific and should remain as-is

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Update Auth Service Controllers**:
   - ✅ Replace imports in `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
   - ✅ Replace imports in `server/apps/auth-service/src/presentation/controllers/auth.controller.ts`
   - ✅ Update import statements to use `@app/dtos`
   - ✅ Verify API documentation still works correctly

2. **Update Auth Service Services**:
   - ✅ Replace imports in `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/auth.service.ts`
   - ✅ Update command handlers to use shared DTOs
   - ✅ Verify type compatibility with existing code
   - ✅ Added `tokenType: 'Bearer'` field to AuthResponseDto objects

3. **Remove Duplicate Files**:
   - ✅ Delete `server/apps/auth-service/src/auth/dto/` directory
   - ✅ Delete `server/apps/auth-service/src/presentation/dtos/auth/` directory
   - ✅ Update index files to remove exports

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - ✅ Run auth-service unit tests (DTO imports working correctly)

- ✅ UUID validation: `@IsUUID()` → `@IsUUIDField()` (Already using shared DTOs)

**User Service**:
- ✅ Username validation: `@Matches(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/)` → `@IsUsernameField()`
- ✅ Display name validation: `@MaxLength(100)` → `@IsDisplayNameField()`
- ✅ UUID validation: `@IsUUID('4')` → `@IsUUIDField()`

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. **Update User Service GraphQL Types**:

## Best Practices

### Using Shared Modules

1. **Import Consistently**: Always import from the shared module, not individual files
2. **Extend When Needed**: Create service-specific DTOs by extending shared ones
3. **Document Usage**: Add comments explaining why shared patterns are used
4. **Test Integration**: Ensure shared modules work correctly in your service context

### Contributing to Shared Modules

1. **Follow Patterns**: Maintain consistency with existing shared module patterns
2. **Add Documentation**: Include comprehensive JSDoc comments
3. **Write Tests**: Add tests for new shared functionality
4. **Consider Impact**: Ensure changes don't break existing services

### Versioning Strategy

1. **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for shared modules
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility when possible
3. **Migration Guides**: Provide migration guides for breaking changes
4. **Deprecation Notices**: Give advance notice of deprecated features
