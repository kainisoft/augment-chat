- [Authentication Service](server/AUTH_SERVICE_PLAN.md) - Authentication service plan
- [User Service](server/USER_SERVICE_PLAN.md) - User management service plan
- [Chat Service](server/CHAT_SERVICE_PLAN.md) - Chat functionality service plan
- [Notification Service](server/NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PLAN.md) - Notifications service plan

## Client-Side Development
- [Web Client](client/WEB_CLIENT_PLAN.md) - Next.js web application plan
- [Mobile Client](client/MOBILE_CLIENT_PLAN.md) - Future mobile application plan

## Infrastructure & Deployment
- [Database Plan](DATABASE_PLAN.md) - Database architecture and implementation
- [Docker Development Environment](DOCKER_PLAN.md) - Local development with Docker
- [AWS Deployment](AWS_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md) - Production deployment on AWS

## Current Progress

### Server Development
- [x] Phase 1, Step 1: Initialize NestJS monorepo using Workspaces with Fastify
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 2: Set up Docker configuration for local development
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 3: Configure Kafka for local development
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 4: Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB with Docker Compose

### Client Development
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 1: Initialize Next.js web client project
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 2: Set up Next.js with Apollo Client
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 3: Configure project structure and styling with Tailwind CSS

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 1: Create Docker Compose configuration for local development
- [ ] Phase 1, Step 2: Set up service-specific Dockerfiles

## Next Steps
1. Complete Docker configuration for local development
2. Set up database containers (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
3. Configure Redis Cluster with private IP communication
4. Configure Kafka for inter-service communication
5. Initialize the Next.js web client project

## Special Implementation Notes
- Redis will be implemented as a custom Redis Cluster on EC2 instances in production
- All Redis communication will use private IP addresses for security
- Local development will simulate the cluster setup with Docker containers
