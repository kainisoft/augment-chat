# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix loading component styles with vanilla CSS
  - Replace `@apply` directives with vanilla CSS equivalents in loading component SCSS
  - Implement CSS custom properties for theming support
  - Add proper CSS animations for spinner, dots, and pulse effects
  - Ensure all loading component variants work without Tailwind dependencies
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Configure ng-packagr for Tailwind processing
  - Create ng-package.json configuration for shared-lib with PostCSS support
  - Update shared library build configuration to process Tailwind directives
  - Add necessary PostCSS plugins for library builds
  - Test library build process with Tailwind integration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Create library-specific Tailwind configuration
  - Create tailwind.lib.config.js optimized for library builds
  - Configure content paths to include only shared-lib files
  - Enable only essential Tailwind plugins for library use
  - Set up purging strategy for library-specific builds
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement style loading detection and fallbacks
  - Add utility function to detect if Tailwind classes are loaded
  - Create fallback style system for when Tailwind is not available
  - Implement dynamic style application based on detection results
  - Add CSS feature detection for animation support
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3, 3.1_

- [ ] 5. Update build scripts and configuration
  - Modify package.json scripts to support library-specific Tailwind builds
  - Update Angular workspace configuration for enhanced style processing
  - Add build validation scripts to check style processing
  - Create development scripts for testing library styles
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 6. Add comprehensive tests for style integration
  - Write unit tests for loading component with different style configurations
  - Create integration tests for library build process
  - Add visual regression tests for component styling
  - Implement build process validation tests
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Update documentation and examples
  - Document the new style integration approach
  - Create examples showing proper usage of styled components
  - Add troubleshooting guide for style-related issues
  - Update component documentation with styling information
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Optimize and validate the solution
  - Measure bundle size impact of the new approach
  - Validate cross-browser compatibility of animations
