# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The loading component in the shared library is not displaying properly because Tailwind CSS classes are not being processed correctly when the library is built. The component shows only text instead of the expected spinner animation. This issue stems from the fact that Angular libraries don't automatically process Tailwind's `@apply` directives during the library build process, causing the styles to not be applied in consuming applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the shared library, I want the loading component to display a proper animated spinner, so that users see visual feedback during loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the loading component is used with type="spinner" THEN the system SHALL display an animated spinning circle
2. WHEN the loading component is rendered THEN the system SHALL apply all Tailwind CSS classes correctly
3. WHEN the shared library is built THEN the system SHALL include processed CSS styles that work in consuming applications
4. WHEN the loading component is used in any Angular application THEN the system SHALL display consistent styling regardless of the consuming app's Tailwind configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the shared library, I want Tailwind CSS to be properly integrated with Angular library builds, so that all components render with correct styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the shared library THEN the system SHALL process all `@apply` directives in component SCSS files
2. WHEN using Tailwind classes in library components THEN the system SHALL include the necessary CSS in the built library
3. WHEN the library is consumed by applications THEN the system SHALL not require the consuming app to have identical Tailwind configuration
4. WHEN library components use Tailwind utilities THEN the system SHALL ensure styles are self-contained within the library

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the Angular workspace, I want a consistent approach to styling across all projects, so that components work reliably in different applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components use Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL provide a reliable build process that works for both applications and libraries
2. WHEN developing new components THEN the system SHALL support both direct Tailwind classes and `@apply` directives
3. WHEN building different project types (apps vs libraries) THEN the system SHALL handle Tailwind processing appropriately for each
4. WHEN updating Tailwind configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure changes are reflected in all built artifacts
