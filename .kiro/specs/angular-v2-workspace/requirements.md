# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a multi-project Angular V2 workspace that will serve as the foundation for implementing the advanced Angular chat application. The workspace will be structured to support the phased development approach outlined in the Angular V2 Implementation Plan, with a focus on modern Angular features, scalability, and maintainability.

The workspace will be created in the `/client/web/angularV2` directory and will include the necessary project structure, configuration, and initial skeleton applications to support the 8-phase implementation plan.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing setup, so that I can ensure code quality and reliability throughout development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing is configured THEN the system SHALL set up Jest for unit testing with 95%+ coverage targets
2. WHEN integration testing is needed THEN the system SHALL configure Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
3. WHEN code quality is enforced THEN the system SHALL include automated testing pipelines
4. WHEN accessibility testing is required THEN the system SHALL integrate automated accessibility testing tools
5. WHEN performance testing is needed THEN the system SHALL configure Core Web Vitals monitoring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development and build optimization, so that I can have efficient development workflows and optimized production builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development environment is set up THEN the system SHALL configure hot module replacement (HMR) for fast development
2. WHEN build optimization is implemented THEN the system SHALL enable advanced tree-shaking and code splitting
3. WHEN bundle analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL include webpack bundle analyzer configuration
4. WHEN performance is optimized THEN the system SHALL configure lazy loading strategies for routes and modules
5. WHEN production builds are created THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles with source maps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security and compliance features configured, so that the application meets enterprise security standards from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security is configured THEN the system SHALL include Content Security Policy (CSP) headers configuration
2. WHEN authentication is set up THEN the system SHALL configure JWT token handling with secure storage
3. WHEN compliance is considered THEN the system SHALL include GDPR compliance tools and configurations
4. WHEN security scanning is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate automated vulnerability scanning
5. WHEN audit logging is required THEN the system SHALL configure comprehensive security audit trails

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD pipeline configuration, so that I can automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria
