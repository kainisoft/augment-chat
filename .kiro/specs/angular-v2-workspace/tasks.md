## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Each task should be implemented using test-driven development (TDD) where applicable
- All components must use standalone architecture with signals
- Code should follow strict TypeScript configuration and ESLint rules
- Accessibility must be considered in every UI component implementation
- Performance implications should be evaluated for each feature
- **Backend Integration**: All API integrations should work with the existing NestJS microservice architecture
- **Authentication**: Use existing JWT-based authentication system and role-based permissions
- **Real-time Features**: Integrate with existing WebSocket implementation for chat functionality
- **Data Models**: Align frontend models with existing backend GraphQL schema and API contracts

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests should achieve 95%+ code coverage
- Integration tests should cover all major user workflows
- E2E tests should validate complete user journeys
- Accessibility tests should run automatically on all components
- Performance tests should validate Core Web Vitals metrics

### Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass ESLint and Prettier checks
- TypeScript strict mode must be maintained throughout
- Components should use OnPush change detection strategy
- Services should use signal-based state management where appropriate
- All public APIs should be properly documented with JSDoc

### Security Considerations
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Authentication tokens should be handled securely
- HTTPS must be enforced in all environments
- Content Security Policy should be properly configured
- Regular security audits should be performed

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a modern, scalable, and feature-rich Angular V2 workspace with advanced multi-theme capabilities. Each task builds incrementally toward the final goal while maintaining code quality, performance, and security standards.
